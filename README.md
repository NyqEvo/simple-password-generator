# Simple Password Generator

![alt text](./pictures/site-pic.png)

## Description 
This project is made to quickly create a randomly generated password between the lengths of 8 to 128 characters. this includes special characters, upper and lower case, as well as numbers. This was made to show proficiency in creating functions in javascript as well as using proper conditionals and using iteration. This also includes using window prompts and alerts. Through this project I was able to reliably use my knowledge of javascript to create this password generator in a relatively short amount of time.
